1) Simple hide (attrib) — no admin needed, not secure
Hides the folder (hidden + system). Anyone who knows how to show hidden/system files can see it.
Save as hide_folder.cmd:

# Hide
@echo off
if "%~1"=="" (
  echo Usage: %~nx0 "C:\path\to\folder"
  exit /b 1
)
set "F=%~1"
attrib +h +s "%F%"
echo Folder hidden: %F%

# Unhide
attrib -h -s "C:\path\to\folder"
echo Folder unhidden


2) "Locker" rename trick — hides and prevents casual browsing
This is the classic batch locker that renames folder to a Control Panel CLSID so Explorer opens it as Control Panel instead of showing contents. Not secure — anyone can revert the name or list files.
Save as locker.cmd:

@echo off
set "F=%~1"
if "%F%"=="" (
  echo Usage: %~nx0 "C:\path\to\MyFolder"
  exit /b 1
)
if not exist "%F%" (
  echo Folder not found: %F%
  exit /b 1
)
:: If folder name already contains CLSID, restore it
echo %~nxF | findstr /i "{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}" >nul
if %errorlevel%==0 (
  ren "%F%" "%~nF"
  echo Folder unlocked (restored name)
  exit /b 0
)
:: Lock it
ren "%F%" "%~nxF.{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}"
echo Folder locked (Explorer will open Control Panel view)

# Usage: locker.cmd "C:\path\to\MyFolder"


3) Encrypt for the current user (EFS with cipher) — protects from other local accounts (best option without admin)
cipher (EFS) encrypts files so only the same Windows user account can read them. Requires NTFS and Windows versions that support EFS (Pro/Enterprise). No admin required for encrypting your own files. Does not protect against someone with admin privileges or if attacker has access to your user account or backups of the EFS keys.
